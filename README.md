# compression-encryption
Developed a GUI on Data Compression and Encryption in Java on NetBeans.

It uses the Huffman Algorithm for compression/decompression of file. For encryption AES Algorithm approved by NSIT is used.

It has option for whether you want only to compress or encrypt and/or apply both to your text file (I have only made for text file at the moment, but will add more to it). You can browse for file anywhere from your system and choose from the available buttons('Compress', 'Decompress', 'Encrypt' and 'Decrypt').   

# Steps to do Compression+Encryption
1. Choose the file(.txt) on which you wish to apply the changes.
2. If you solely wish to do Compression/Decompression or Encryption/Decryption, I have made available the buttons which will do the job     for you.
3. And, if you want to apply both to your files, you may first apply Compression and then Encryption or vice-versa.

If you have a large file, I first recommend you doing Compression of your file and then the Encrytion as it will save time in doing it.
